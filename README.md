# ue4-snippets package

Adds useful snippets for working with Unreal Engine 4 C++ Code.  
This is especially useful on Linux, as auto-completion in IDEs seems to fail a lot due to UE4s huge codebase.  
All snippets start with the letter *u*, so if you're looking for all the snippets, just type that and explore :)
