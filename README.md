# ue4-snippets package

Adds useful snippets for working with Unreal Engine 4 C++ Code.  
This is especially useful on Linux, as auto-completion in IDEs seems to fail a lot due to UE4s huge codebase.  
All snippets start with the letter *u*, so if you're looking for all the snippets, just type that and explore :)  

### Currently includes snippets for:
* print strings to screen
* print messages to log
* spawn emitters at location / attached
* play sounds at location / attached
* spawn actors
* spawn actors deferred
* safely get world (with if check, needed for spawning things)
* create UEnums
* create UStructs
* create UClasses (as if you ever needed to but why not)
* cast UObjects
* uproperty and ufunction macro
* creating default subobjects (components)
* single & multi linetrace by channel/object/profile
* single & multi overlap by channel/object/profile
* multi sweep by channel/object/profile
* set timer & clear timer
* input axis & input action binding
* subclass pointer
* replication functions
* getting all actors of a class
* finding Datatable rows
